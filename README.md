# AlgorithmSolutions
I have tried to solve each algorithm that I studied in my own way and tried to optimize the solution:

# Algorithms implemented so far

* Merge Sort algorithm
* Insertion Sort algorithm
* Bubble Sort algorithm
* Maximum Sub array algorithm
* Heap DS and also heap sort algorithm (Min heap only)
* Priority Queue implementation
* Quick Sort algorithm
* Counting Sort algorithm


# Coding questions of each Data Structure solved:

1. String and Arrays:
    - Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures? (C102)

    - Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. (C102)


2. Linked List:
